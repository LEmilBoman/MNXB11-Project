    2. CSV: Pavel
    3. Date: Emil
    4. ROOT: Nils
    5. fmt: optional (see if we need it)

Dataset:
    
Project parts:
    Data Preparation/Cleanup: Emil makes bash script.
    Emil: Compare number of days with winter temperatures (av. temp.<0 C) per year in Lund, Uppsala, and Luleå.
     Time period 1964-2022.
      Data Extraction: Bash script for extracting days with negative temperature.
                       Treat calculation of average temperatures and extraction of winter temperature days in c++.
      Data Analysis: Calculate relative change over time: (numb. WD in Lund/numb. WD in Luleå), (numb. WD in Uppsala/numb. WD in Luleå)
      Figure Generation: Plot with number of winterdays per year from 1964-2022 for all 3 cities.
                         Plot with relative change over time for both Lund and Uppsala.
